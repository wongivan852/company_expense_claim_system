# Django Expense Claim Management System - Requirements Analysis

Based on the requirements document, I need to completely restructure this project from FastAPI to Django. Here are the key changes needed:

## Framework Change
- **Current**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
- **Required**: Django 4.2+ with Django REST Framework

## Key Requirements Summary:

### 1. Technical Stack
- Django 4.2+ with DRF
- PostgreSQL/MySQL database  
- Redis for caching
- Celery for background tasks
- Docker containerization

### 2. Frontend Requirements
- Django templates with Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript/jQuery
- Chart.js for analytics
- Multi-language support (Chinese/English)

### 3. User Roles
- Staff: Create/edit/submit claims
- Manager: Review/approve/reject claims  
- Admin: System configuration

### 4. Core Features
- Multi-currency support (HKD, RMB, USD, TWD)
- Live exchange rate integration
- Document/receipt management
- Workflow management with approval states
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

### 5. Geographic Considerations
- China and Hong Kong operations
- Timezone handling (HKT/CST)
- Regulatory compliance

### 6. Security & Performance
- RBAC, 2FA, encryption
- 100+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime
- Mobile responsive

## Action Plan:
1. Restructure project for Django
2. Create Django apps (accounts, claims, documents, reports)
3. Implement models based on expense claim template
4. Create Django REST API endpoints
5. Add internationalization support
6. Implement workflow management
7. Add reporting and analytics

Would you like me to proceed with restructuring this as a Django project?
